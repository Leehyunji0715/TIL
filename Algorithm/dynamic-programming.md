###Problem on recursion
Recursively constructed function could take long time to return result.
For example, there's Fibonacci function (int fib(n)).
When n is big enough like 50, it takes long long time.


###Light Note
When I tried to solve problem #10 in 'leetcode', it says the problem is related to DP(Dynamic Programming).
This is what I studied to solve it.
